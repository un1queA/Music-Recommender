Hello! 
This is an AI Music Recommender that helps recommend and suggest artist and songs based on the given genre. The app uses langchain, gpt4 to recommend 3 songs from the given genre. It will NOT recommend artists that have already been mentioned in the same session and will also be able to suggest songs using different languages. The app will suggest songs that can be found from the artist's offical youtube channel. I have provided the source code and requirements via requirements.txt.

In order to run it on your local machine make sure to have the #prerequisites installed on your machine and run it in command prompt with admin privileges. Also, make sure to have GPT's API key as well to be able to interact with the app. Do note that that the app is made using the current versions of langchain, openai, youtubesearch function etc. This is not made to be scalable and the code might not work due to version deprecation.
If thats the case make sure to have the latest versions of #prerequisties installed!
Have fun!

only till 2024
