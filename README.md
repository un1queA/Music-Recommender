Hello! 
This is an AI Music Recommender that helps recommend and suggest artist and songs based on the given genre. I have provided the source code and requirements via Music Recommender.py.
In order to run it on your local machine make sure to have the #prerequisites installed on your machine and run it in command prompt with admin privileges. Do note that that the app is made using the current versions of langhchain, openai, youtubesearch function etc. This is not made to be scalable and the code might not work due to version deprecation.
If thats the case make sure to have the latest versions of #prerequisties installed!
Have fun!
